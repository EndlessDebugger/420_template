# Course Setup 


- You will need a github account, and a basic understanding of git
- You will need python3 or C++
- You will also need the following python packages: 
- Make sure your python has tkinter, future, heapq
  - If your python does not have tkinter, here is how to install it:
    - On Linux run: sudo apt install python3-tk
    - On MacOS, get homebrew then run: brew install python-tk
    - On Windows, make sure the "tcl/tk and IDLE" checkbox is checked when installing python
from the python website. Reinstalling python and checking the box is probably the easiest way
to enable it.

Once you have a github account
1. Go to https://github.com/EndlessDebugger/420_template
2. Click "Use Template -> Create a new repository" (use whatever name you like)
3. Make sure to make the repository private
4. Go to settings, Collaborators, Add people, and add `ioerger`, and `EndlessDebugger`
